## Certificates and Profiles

A certificate identifies who you are, a profile identifies the application.

You need both a production certificate (for distribution) and a development certificate (for testing/debug purposes)

Both can be created with "Keychain Access", (Select login > My Certificates, then "Keychain Access" > "Certificate Assistent" > "Request a Certficiate from a Certificate Authority").

Then upload them to developer.apple.com/account ($$)

Download them, then double-click to open in Keychain Access
